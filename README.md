# Real-Time Face Recognition System
I developed a Python-based real-time face recognition project using OpenCV under the guidance of the Wscubetech YouTube channel. The project captures live video from a webcam, converts each frame to grayscale, and utilizes a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces. Detected faces are highlighted with green rectangles, and the live feed continuously updates until the user presses the designated exit key.
