# Real-Time Face Recognition System (Guided by Wscubetech YouTube Channel)
Developed a Python-based face recognition project using OpenCV. The application captures live video from the webcam, converts each frame to grayscale, and utilizes a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time. Detected faces are marked with green rectangles, and the live feed updates continuously until terminated by the user.
